### What is this repository for? ###

If you're an indie hacker launching a new product then you need a no-nonsense landing page.
This repository provides the blocks and structure for you to create your own landing page.
It follows [Julian Shapiro's guide to growth marketing](https://www.julian.com/learn/growth/landing-pages). Just
swap out the text and images for your own.

### How do I get set up? ###

1 - Install dependencies:

    npm install

2 - Build and serve the page:

    gulp serve

Browse to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the landing page.

N.B. this command will also watch for file changes and automatically refresh your browser with the latest code.


### How do I make changes? ###

Smooth Landing ðŸ›¬ uses Pug (formerly 'Jade') and SASS to improve the developer experience. If you're unfamiliar with these languages, you can learn more here:

* [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/guide)

To change the landing page, just edit `src/index.pug`. Images are kept in `dist/img` and the `index.html` page is built to the `dist` directory.
To host a landing page, copy the `dist` directory to your web server.
