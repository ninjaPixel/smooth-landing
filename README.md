### What is this repository for? ###

If you're an indie hacker launching a new product then you need a no-nonsense landing page.
This repository provides the blocks and structure for you to create your own landing page.
It follows [Julian Shapiro's guide to growth marketing](https://www.julian.com/learn/growth/landing-pages). Just
swap out the text and images for your own.

In addition to following these best practices the page is designed to load very fast and it scores a performance rating of 97/100 with Google Lighthouse.
